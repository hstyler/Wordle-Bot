# Wordle-Bot
Wordle Discord Bot

A small Wordle clone in the form of a Discord bot!
Requires a word dataset such as [this](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/english-word-frequency) to pull words from. Just download the .csv as wordlist.csv and chuck in the word_lists folder.
Currently has a limit on once per day to preserve the sanctity of Wordle, but can be easily bypassed however you please. :)

Python dependencies can be installed with requirements.txt
